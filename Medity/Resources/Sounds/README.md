# Resources/Sounds

Drop ambient audio files here to upgrade the procedural fallbacks from
`AudioEngine`. Files take precedence over the synth — when a matching
file is present, sessions play the recording; when absent, the engine
falls back to the procedural generator (or silence for unsupported ids).

## Naming convention

The file's name (without extension) must match the `fileName` declared
in `SoundCatalog.swift`:

| Sound id          | Expected file name     |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| `rain.light`      | `rain-light`           |
| `rain.heavy`      | `rain-heavy`           |
| `ocean.waves`     | `ocean-waves`          |
| `ocean.shore`     | `ocean-shore`          |
| `forest`          | `forest`               |
| `river`           | `river`                |
| `fire`            | `fire`                 |
| `wind`            | `wind`                 |
| `tibetan-bowls`   | `tibetan-bowls`        |
| `om-chant`        | `om-chant`             |
| `temple`          | `temple`               |

`noise.white` / `noise.pink` / `noise.brown` and `silence` have no
`fileName` — they're always procedural.

## File format

Tried in order: `.caf` → `.m4a` → `.mp3` → `.wav`. Pick whichever is
most convenient. The current bundle uses `.m4a` (AAC in MP4) since
`afconvert` / `ffmpeg`'s AAC-in-CAF path is fragile; `.m4a` is iOS-native.

Recommended: 96 kbps mono AAC. For an ambient bed mono is plenty,
and 96 kbps is the sweet spot between artifacts and size.

```sh
ffmpeg -i input.ogg -c:a aac -b:a 96k -ac 1 output.m4a
```

## Length

Aim for **30 s – 2 min** of seamlessly-loopable content per sound. The
engine reads the file fully into memory and loops via
`scheduleBuffer(.loops)`. For seamless loops, edit so the start sample
matches the end sample (crossfade the last 1 s onto the first 1 s of
itself in Audacity → Effect → Crossfade Tracks).

## Where to find files

- **commons.wikimedia.org** — Public Domain / CC-BY / CC-BY-SA, direct
  download URLs (predictable upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/X/XY/Filename
  pattern). Best source for tibetan bowls, om chants, nature recordings.
- **archive.org** — public domain audio collections, long-form recordings.
- **freesound.org** — large CC-licensed library, requires account.
- **pixabay.com/sound-effects** — royalty-free, no attribution required.
- **mixkit.co/free-sound-effects** — clean catalog, free for commercial use.

## Adding a file

1. Drop `your-sound.m4a` (matching the catalog name) into this directory.
2. Run `xcodegen generate` from the project root — xcodegen picks up the
   file and adds it to the bundle's resources phase.
3. Build & run. Pick the sound in the library; you'll hear the recording
   instead of the procedural fallback.

To revert to the procedural version, just delete the file and regenerate.

shipping app — typically a "Sound credits" entry in the About / Acknowledgements
screen.

### Still procedural (no recording yet)

- `rain.heavy` — heavier filtered noise + extra bass
- `ocean.shore` — same generator, slower LFO period
- `wind` — pink noise with 9 s amplitude LFO
- `river` — brown noise with HF emphasis
- `om-chant` — TODO, sourceable from Wikimedia "Audio files of Buddhist chants"
- `temple` — TODO, search "monastery ambience"
- `noise.*` — always procedural by design (they're math, not recordings)
